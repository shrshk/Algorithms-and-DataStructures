Algos and Ds problems
Algos n Ds are important parts of computer science, since  most of the problems which occur in real life are covered in them,
In this project I've implemented most common datastructures like Stack, LinkedList, Arrays, BST etc and solved some problems on those, hope this is
helpful.
