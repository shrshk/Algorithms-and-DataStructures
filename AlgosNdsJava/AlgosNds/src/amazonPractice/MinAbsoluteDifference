You are given an array arr of n elements of positive integers. Your task is to determine the minimum absolute difference between any 2 elements of the array. You can perform the following two types of operations on the array elements any number of times:

If element e is even, then you can replace it by e / 2
If element e is odd, then you can replace it by 2 * e
Determine the minimum absolute difference between any two elements after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero) on any element of the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2]
Output: 0
Constraints:

1<= T <=50
2<= n <=50000
1<= arr[i] <=10^8 for each valid i
Time limit: 1 sec

It is guaranteed that summation of n over all test cases does not exceed 250000.


Arrays.sort(nums);

int minDiff = Integer.max_value;
int i=0;
while (i<nums.length-1) {
	int first = nums[i];
	int secound = nums[i+1];
}
