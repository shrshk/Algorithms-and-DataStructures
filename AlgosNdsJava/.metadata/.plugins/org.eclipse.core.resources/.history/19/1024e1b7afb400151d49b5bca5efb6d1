	 * 2. Then recursively, find the middle element of the left part
	 * of the array and make it the left child.
	 * 3. Then recursively find the middle element of the right part
	 * of the array and make it the right child of node in step 1.

	 * The solution is implemented within the BinarySearchTree & TreeNode classes
	 * The methods have been implemented as static factory methods. Check out the main method below
	 * on how to invoke it.
